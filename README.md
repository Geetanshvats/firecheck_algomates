## 🚀 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Duality AI – Space Station Hackathon**. The YOLOv8 model was trained using synthetic image data generated with **Falcon** — a digital twin simulator. Users can upload environment snapshots (e.g., space stations or factories), and FireCheck will detect whether required safety equipment is present.
